# Layered Architecture - Architectural Patterns Perspective

Layered Architecture, also known as the n-tier architecture, is a software design pattern that divides an application into a set of interconnected layers, where each layer provides specific functionality. This separation helps in managing complexity, promoting modularity, and improving maintainability of the software system.

## Key Concepts:

### 1. Presentation Layer:

- **Definition:** The top layer responsible for user interface and interaction. It handles user input, displays information to users, and sends requests to the underlying layers.
- **Example:** In a web application, the presentation layer includes the user interface components, HTML/CSS for rendering, and client-side scripts for handling user interactions.

### 2. Application Layer (Business Logic):

- **Definition:** The middle layer containing the business logic, application-specific rules, and workflow. It processes requests from the presentation layer, performs operations, and interacts with the data layer.
- **Example:** In an e-commerce application, the application layer manages processes like order processing, inventory management, and payment processing.

### 3. Data Layer:

- **Definition:** The bottom layer responsible for data storage, retrieval, and management. It interacts with databases or external services to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- **Example:** In a customer relationship management (CRM) system, the data layer stores and retrieves customer information, such as names, addresses, and contact details.

### 4. Communication Between Layers:

- **Definition:** Layers communicate through well-defined interfaces. Each layer interacts only with adjacent layers, promoting modularity and flexibility.
- **Example:** The presentation layer may send a request to the application layer to retrieve product details. The application layer processes the request and retrieves the necessary data from the data layer.

## Real-World Scenario:

Consider a banking application using a layered architecture.

- **Presentation Layer:**

  - *Example:*
    - The presentation layer includes the user interface of the banking application, consisting of web pages or mobile app screens. Users interact with this layer to perform actions like viewing account balances, transferring funds, or paying bills.
- **Application Layer (Business Logic):**

  - *Example:*
    - The application layer manages the business logic of the banking operations. It processes requests from the presentation layer, such as transferring funds between accounts. It validates the transactions, checks account balances, and ensures that the business rules are followed.
- **Data Layer:**

  - *Example:*
    - The data layer stores customer information, account details, and transaction records. It interacts with a database to persist and retrieve data. For example, when a user checks their account balance, the data layer retrieves the relevant information from the database.
- **Communication Between Layers:**

  - *Example:*
    - When a user initiates a fund transfer (presentation layer), the request is sent to the application layer. The application layer checks the user's account balance and validates the transaction. Once validated, it communicates with the data layer to update the transaction records and adjust the account balances accordingly.

## Conclusion:

Layered Architecture provides a structured and organized approach to software design by dividing an application into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility. This separation of concerns improves the maintainability, scalability, and flexibility of the software system. In the context of a banking application, the layered architecture ensures that user interfaces, business logic, and data management are modular and can evolve independently, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements.
