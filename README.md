# Software Architectural Patterns

This repository provides an overview of common architectural patterns in system design, along with detailed explanations and real-world examples.

## 1. Layered Architecture:

### Definition:

Layered architecture organizes a system into logical layers, each responsible for a specific set of functionality. Communication between layers is strictly defined, promoting modularity and structured software design.

### Example:

In a banking application, the presentation layer handles user interactions, the business logic layer processes transactions, and the data access layer communicates with the database. This separation facilitates easier maintenance and scalability.

## 2. Model-View-Controller (MVC):

### Definition:

MVC separates an application into three interconnected components - Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller (handles user input and updates the model). This separation enhances code organization and maintainability.

### Example:

In a healthcare management system, the Model manages patient data, the View displays medical records, and the Controller handles user inputs like scheduling appointments. MVC allows for easy modification of the user interface without affecting underlying logic.

## 3. Microservices Architecture:

### Definition:

Microservices architecture structures an application as a collection of small, independent services, each focused on a specific business capability. Services communicate through well-defined APIs, enabling independent development and scaling.

### Example:

In an online retail platform, microservices could include Product Service, Order Service, and User Service. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, providing flexibility and resilience.

## 4. Event-Driven Architecture:

### Definition:

Event-Driven Architecture involves components that communicate through events, triggering the execution of associated handlers. This promotes loose coupling between components.

### Example:

In a shipping logistics system, an event is triggered upon package delivery. The inventory management system subscribes to update stock levels, and the customer notification system subscribes to send delivery notifications.

## 5. Component-Based Architecture:

### Definition:

Component-Based Architecture organizes software as a collection of reusable, self-contained components or modules. Each component encapsulates specific functionality, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

### Example:

In a content management system, components could include User Authentication, Content Storage, and Rendering. These components can be reused across different pages or projects, simplifying development and maintenance.

## Real-world Scenario:

Consider an e-commerce website transitioning from a monolithic to a microservices architecture. The monolithic architecture represents the original setup, while the microservices architecture decomposes the system into independent services, addressing scalability and maintenance challenges.
