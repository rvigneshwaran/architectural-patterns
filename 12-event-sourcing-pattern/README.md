# Event Sourcing Architecture - Architectural Patterns Perspective

Event Sourcing Architecture is a design pattern that revolves around capturing and persisting every state change in an application as a series of immutable events. This approach differs from traditional systems that primarily store the current state, as event sourcing maintains a historical log of events, providing a detailed record of how the system arrived at its current state. This pattern is often used in conjunction with Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) to enhance flexibility and scalability.

## Key Concepts:

### 1. Events:

- **Definition:** Events are immutable facts that represent state changes in the system. Each event captures a specific occurrence and is stored in the event log. Events act as the source of truth for the system's history.
- **Example:** In a banking application, events can include "AccountOpened," "FundsDeposited," or "WithdrawalRequested."

### 2. Event Log:

- **Definition:** The event log is a persistent, append-only store that records events in the order they occur. It serves as a comprehensive and unalterable history of all state changes in the application.
- **Example:** A relational database, a dedicated event store, or a distributed log like Apache Kafka can function as an event log, ensuring durability and reliability.

### 3. Aggregate:

- **Definition:** An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit. Events are applied to aggregates to rebuild their state, and each aggregate represents a distinct entity or business concept.
- **Example:** In an e-commerce system, an order can be an aggregate that receives events like "OrderPlaced," "ProductAdded," and "PaymentReceived."

### 4. Event Handlers:

- **Definition:** Event handlers are components responsible for updating the state of aggregates based on incoming events. They interpret events and apply them to aggregates to reconstruct their current state.
- **Example:** An event handler for a customer aggregate might apply events like "CustomerRegistered" or "AddressUpdated" to update the customer's information.

### 5. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):

- **Definition:** CQRS is a pattern that separates the responsibilities of handling write operations (commands) from those of handling read operations (queries). It complements event sourcing by allowing different models for updates and retrievals.
- **Example:** Write commands, such as "PlaceOrder" or "UpdateProfile," are handled separately from read queries, like "GetOrderDetails" or "GetUserProfile."

## Real-World Scenario:

Consider a more detailed real-world scenario of applying Event Sourcing Architecture in a collaborative document editing system.

- **Events:**

  - *Example:*
    - Events include "DocumentCreated," "TextAdded," "TextUpdated," and "TextDeleted." Each event captures a specific change to the document, providing a granular history.
- **Event Log:**

  - *Example:*
    - The event log, stored in a dedicated event store, maintains a chronological sequence of events. For instance, the log records the creation of a document, additions, updates, and deletions of text, forming a comprehensive history.
- **Aggregate:**

  - *Example:*
    - The document itself acts as an aggregate. Events, such as "TextAdded" or "TextUpdated," are applied to the document aggregate to rebuild its content. The aggregate represents the evolving state of the document.
- **Event Handlers:**

  - *Example:*
    - Event handlers, responsible for updating the document's state, interpret incoming events. The "TextAdded" event handler, for example, appends the added text to the document, maintaining a consistent and up-to-date representation.
- **CQRS:**

  - *Example:*
    - CQRS is applied by separating write commands, such as "AddText" or "DeleteText," from read queries, like "GetDocumentContent." This separation allows for optimized handling of write operations and retrieval of document content, enhancing performance and scalability.

## Conclusion:

Event Sourcing Architecture offers a powerful way to capture and maintain a detailed history of state changes in a system. In the collaborative document editing scenario, events are recorded in an event log, allowing the reconstruction of the document's evolving state. Aggregates represent units of change, and event handlers update their state based on incoming events. The incorporation of CQRS provides a clear separation between write and read operations, facilitating flexibility and scalability. Event sourcing is particularly valuable in applications where a comprehensive history of changes is essential, such as auditing, versioning, or collaborative editing systems.
